Every script in this folder is an adapted version of a script from Chang et al. (2019). For a description of the complete pipeline, look at 'LandscapeMain.R' and 'Readme.txt' on the parent folder.

'utils' contains unmodified scripts used in Chang et al. (2019).

'mapper output' and 'jsds' are generated when creating the mapper networks and the Jensen Shannon distances respectively.

'General.R' in the parent folder will call every script here in order.
